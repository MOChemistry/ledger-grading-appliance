# Unified OCR for Ledger's white-digit-in-dark-box marks (footer page number).
# Never crops-and-inverts a rectangle: the box's own dark rim would invert
# into a black stroke flush against the digits, which tesseract reads as
# '|' / '[' / ']' / '0'. Instead, fill the box contour into a mask and take
# the digits as the LIGHT pixels INSIDE it. The rim is dark, so it can never
# enter the crop.
#
# [PATCH:boxed-digit-ocr-v3] (Rev jjj) Grayscale-first + multi-PSM vote.
# v2 failed on thin-stroke serif footers (LibreOffice / Liberation Serif,
# Gilded Age Test: 12/16, incl. SILENT '16'->'1'): binarizing at native
# resolution + a 2x2 MORPH_OPEN deleted ~1 px strokes, and the fixed 9 px
# mask erosion clipped digits near the rim of small boxes. v3:
#   1. mask erosion is box-proportional (never > box/8, floor 2 px)
#   2. digits stay GRAYSCALE through the upscale; Otsu binarization happens
#      only at target height, followed by CLOSE (heals hairline breaks;
#      never OPEN, which amputates thin strokes)
#   3. speck removal by connected-component area, not morphology
#   4. tesseract votes across several PSMs; winner = highest per-word
#      confidence, agreement count breaks ties (fixes the chronic '11'->'1'
#      weakness of lone PSM 8, all fonts)

# Serif + Liberation Sans Bold, box heights 55/90/140 px, clean + scan-
